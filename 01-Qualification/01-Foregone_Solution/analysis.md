Foregone Solution: Analysis
My Approach
This is rather straightforward. The input number is scanned character-by-character as a string. If the character is 4, then A gets 1 and B gets 3. Else, A gets 0 and B gets the number. A is converted to integer at the end to eliminate preceding 0's

To simplify more, just replace all the 4's as 3's, and the other number is the difference
