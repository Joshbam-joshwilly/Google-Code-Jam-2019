You Can Go Your Own Way: Analysis
My Approach
The most efficient way to not copy Lydia's footsteps is to anti-copy her footsteps, by walking a path that is reflective compared to Lydia's, like such:


In programming terms, replace all S's with E's, and all E's with S's

This path is guaranteed that you would not retrace Lydia's steps, as all steps are reflective of Lydia's
